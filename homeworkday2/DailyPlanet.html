                <h3>Obama to request $1.8bn to fight Zika</h3>
                <article>The virus, which is transmitted primarily through mosquitoes, has spread rapidly through the Americas.
                It has been linked to a condition called microcephaly, in which babies are born with underdeveloped brains.
                The money will go to mosquito control efforts and vaccine research programmes among other initiatives.
                The White House says that come of the money will go towards "enhancing the ability of Zika-affected countries to better combat mosquitoes and control transmission" of the virus.
